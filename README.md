## What it is

A challenge focused on building the back end of an ecommerce site. User is able to create, edit, view and delete products, categories, and tags.

## What was used

* Node js
* Express js
* mySQL2
* Sequelize
* dotenv
* JavaScript
* Insomnia

## Usage

the user will first need to log into their mySQL using ```mysql -u root -p``` and then run ```source db/schema.sql``` to create the database. After they'll want to quit out of mqSQL and run ```npm run seed``` to seed the data. From there you'll then start the server by entering ```npm start``` into the terminal. The user can then connect Insomnia to the local host to view and make changes.
